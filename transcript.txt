["Relax" playing]
8:30, 9th of July, 1984 and Stefan, a young teenager asleep in bed awakes with a fake gasp clutching his chest. [gasps]

[Relax, don't do it - music continues on the radio]

Next to the desk is a thick, well-thumbed paperback. He turns off the alarm.[music stops]

In the bathroom, the 19-year old who has a mop of curly dark hair, unscrews the top of a bottle of pills and shakes two capsules into the palm of his hand. He swallows them down with a gulp of water from the tap, looking at his reflection.

A 40-year old man comes out of a room. Locking the door, he looks up to see Stefan emerging from the bathroom.
"Breakfast?", he asks.
Stefan walks past him with a smiling nod.

At the breakfast table, now dressed, he's leafing through the thick book.

His dad stubs a cigarette out on a glass ashtray and peers at the boy behind his specs.

and forwards in that."
No, it's a Choose Your Own Adventure" book. You decide what your character does. "-You know, like a game.
